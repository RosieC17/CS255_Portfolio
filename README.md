Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
- The DriverPass project was commissioned by a company offering driving education services. The client wanted a comprehensive web-based system that could manage user sign-ups, schedule driving lessons, track student progress, and offer study resources for driving tests. The goal was to streamline the user experience for both students and instructors while improving overall administrative efficiency.

What did you do particularly well?
- One area I excelled in was gathering and analyzing user requirements. I made sure to communicate with stakeholders frequently to ensure their needs were clearly understood. I also created clear and well-organized design documentation, including data flow diagrams, system models, and user interface mockups, which helped align the team and guide development smoothly.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
- I would revise the use case diagrams. Initially, they lacked detail in some of the alternative and exception flows, which are important for capturing the full range of system behaviors. I would improve them by adding more complete scenarios, including edge cases, and ensuring each use case was tied directly to a user story or requirement.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
- I interpreted user needs by conducting interviews, using surveys, and creating personas that represented different user types like students, instructors, and admins. These insights helped shape the system's core functionality—like user-friendly scheduling tools and adaptive learning modules. Considering user needs is crucial because it ensures the system is usable, efficient, and actually solves the problems users face. A system that ignores user input often results in poor adoption and costly redesigns.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
- I approach software design iteratively, starting with understanding the problem domain and user goals. I use techniques like:

Requirement gathering through stakeholder interviews and user surveys

Modeling tools like UML diagrams, ER diagrams, and wireframes

Agile methodologies for continuous feedback and iteration

Prototyping to test assumptions early
In the future, I plan to enhance this by incorporating user journey mapping and usability testing earlier in the process to catch design issues before development begins.
